need to have the following rubygems installed
	sequel
	open4
	some gem that sequel uses for your database
		postgres-rb, ruby-pg, mysql, etc.

invoke as:

ruby git_extract.rb -n haskell_compiler -r ~/ghc -d postgres://cabird:passwd@localhost/git_database

This is an initial release and has only been tested on postgres and mysql.  Email
me with problems.  cabird@ucdavis.edu
